# Single Responsibility Principle
This principle states a module should only have one responsibility.

The program to demonstrate this is a simple CLI-based slot machine. This program will handle the following operations:
- User input (pull lever, select bet)
- Random number generation for reels
- Symbol matching logic
- Payout calculation
- Displaying results
