# Dependancy Inversion Principle
This principle states that high-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features.

## Program Requirements
* CLI program 
* a Server creates text files
* a Client gets notified if a file was created for them
   * A message gets output to the console that a file was created
   * The file is read by the client and the contents are outputted to the console
