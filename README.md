# SOLID
This project demonstrates the SOLID principles through simple C# programs

## Project Structure
This project follows a monorepo structure where each root folder corresponds to a different .NET C# Solution. Additionally, each root folder will correspond to each SOLID principle. 

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
- Simple program that takes an input and echos it to the console. 
- The source code follow SRP by partitioning the classes into logical blocks that only focus on

### O - Open/Close Principle
- Program extends the functionality inroduced in SRP through he ability to different input and output handlers based on the desired type of input and output.
- The program follow OCP by having more generalized classes to allow for subclassing and extending the functionality of the source code.

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
TBD

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
TBD

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
TBD
