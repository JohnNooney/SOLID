# Open/Close Principle
This principle states a module should be open to extension but closed to modification.

## Program Requirements
* CLI program 
* Outputs a prompt
* Collects user input
    * input is validated for being null or empty
    * if validation fails prompt user to re-try input
* Prints user input back


## Implementation Details
From an implementation perspective, this program will build on top of the program implemented in the Single Responsibility Principle by refactoring the code to follow the OCP.
